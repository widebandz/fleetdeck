"""fleetdeck portal — the front door to every server and agent on this machine.

A single-screen launcher: one tile per local service, each with its own glyph,
a live status lamp, and a link that actually resolves from the phone. Plus one
tile per launchd agent, which is the half a port scan can never see.

The honesty rule: a tile NEVER shows a link the portal has not resolved from
live system state. Three sources, all read fresh on every scan:

  1. `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` — is the port listening, and what did it bind?
     A service on 127.0.0.1 is unreachable from the phone no matter how much we
     would like it to be, and it gets a "host only" badge, not a dead link.
  2. `tailscale serve status --json` — the escape hatch for (1). Loopback-bound
     services that Tailscale already proxies get their real public URL, so they
     are tappable after all.
  3. `launchctl list` + `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` — the scheduled jobs.
     These mostly do not listen on anything, so (1) and (2) are blind to them.

Nothing about a URL is hardcoded. Move a service to a new port, add a
`tailscale serve` mapping, kill a container — the next scan tells the truth
about it without an edit here.

Configuration: config.json next to this file (brand, machine, ports, filters).
Registry:      services.json (hot-reloaded per scan — adding an app is one line).

Access: no password. The socket binds 127.0.0.1 and `tailscale serve` fronts it
with real HTTPS on the tailnet:

    tailscale serve --bg --https=8790 http://127.0.0.1:8790

That front matters more than it looks. Served raw on 0.0.0.0 this failed three
ways an iPhone reports identically as "it won't load":

  1. https://…:8790 was a hard TLS failure (`tlsv1 alert protocol version`).
     Safari upgrades typed hostnames to HTTPS first, so every open paid a failed
     handshake and a fallback — and any saved https bookmark simply never loaded.
  2. A plain-HTTP origin is not a secure context: no service worker, and
     Add to Home Screen degrades.
  3. Reached over the local Wi-Fi instead of the tailnet, the request arrived
     from 192.168.x.x and got a bare 403.

Behind `tailscale serve` all three go away: one https:// URL with a real
Let's Encrypt cert, a secure origin, and requests that arrive from 127.0.0.1.
The tailnet boundary is unchanged — Tailscale enforces it at the proxy now
instead of this process enforcing it per-request, so the local Wi-Fi still
cannot enumerate the box. The per-request check below stays as defence in
depth for the loopback socket. FLEETDECK_OPEN=1 lifts it; FLEETDECK_BIND
overrides the bind if the front is ever removed.

Stdlib only. No build step, no pip, no node.

# Why this and not a phone call: there is no telephony on this machine. No
# Twilio, no SignalWire, no number. A real PSTN call needs a cloud provider and
# a monthly line. What IS here is a full local voice stack — Chatterbox TTS with
# a voice reference at ~/wb-voice/refs/zayed_ref.wav, and whisper.cpp for the
# return leg — so a voice session over the tailnet costs nothing and leaves the
# machine. That is what this is. It is a callback, not a ring.
#
# The briefing is DETERMINISTIC. No model writes it: it is counts and names
# read out of the same scan the board renders and the same graph the lenses
# query. A model in this path would be a model that can invent an outage.
#
# :8890 is not on the tailnet, so the audio is proxied through here rather than
# linked. One origin, and the phone never needs a second port opened.

#
# Resolved from the registry rather than hardcoded, like every other link on
# this board: the cockpit's reachable URL comes from lsof plus `tailscale
# serve`, and only its PATH is swapped. A pasted https:// link here would rot
# the first time the port or the tailnet name moved.
#
# If the cockpit is down the key falls back to /call — the local briefing, which
# needs nothing but this machine. Degrading to something that still works beats
# a dead button, and the label says which one you are getting.
# `?call=1` asked the cockpit for the CALL SCREEN rather than the Trace console.
# Without it the key landed on an admin surface whose own call button was a
# chip in the corner: a call screen handing off to a text UI containing a
# second, smaller CALL. One intent, one screen.
#
# NOW /admin/trace/local, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT VOICE STACK. ElevenLabs began
# refusing sessions on a billing problem (code 1002, "payment issue") and there
# was no way to see it from here — the API key lacks `user_read`, so the quota
# reads 401. A key that opens a call which dies on arrival is worse than one
# that opens a call which works, so it points at the stack that costs nothing:
# whisper.cpp for the ear, the operator's own cloned voice on :8890 for the
# mouth, and the same tool gate behind both.
#
# The trade is push-to-talk instead of full duplex — whisper transcribes a
# finished recording, so there is nothing to hear until you stop speaking.
# ?call=1 still works and is unchanged; it is one edit back if the account is
