"""fleetdeck-skin — dress an app you do not own, from outside it.

Half the tiles on a real board are third-party apps in containers: an LLM
front-end, a database studio, a mail catcher, a metasearch box. None of them
will ever ship an apple-touch-icon that matches your fleet, and none can be
edited — an image tagged `:latest` means anything written into the container is
gone on the next pull. Writing a branding script per image works exactly once
and then has to be maintained per image, forever.

So skin from outside instead. This proxies an app verbatim and rewrites only
its <head> on the way past:

    :8871  fleetdeck-skin  ──>  :8880  the app
             └─ <title>, apple-touch-icon, manifest, theme-color,
                and a stylesheet injected last, so it wins on specificity ties

The container is never touched, which is the whole point: image updates become
irrelevant, and skinning the next app is a `skin` block in services.json rather
than a new script.

    {"id": "tts", "port": 8880, "install": true,
     "skin": {"name": "Script", "port": 8871, "css": "script.css",
              "replace": {"TheirName": "Script"},
              "recolor": {"99, 102, 241": "79, 227, 193"}}}

  port      where this front listens. Give it a `tailscale serve` mapping and
            point the phone at that; the portal resolves the tile to the front
            automatically when it is up, and falls back to the bare app when
            it is not.
  name      <title> and the home-screen name.
  css       a file in skins/, injected last so it beats their stylesheets.
  icon_set  which icons/<name>-*.png to serve; defaults to the service id.
  replace   literal substitutions in text/html — for names an app paints into
            its own markup, which no stylesheet can reach.
  recolor   literal substitutions in text/css — for colours an app hardcoded
            past its own variables. A colour map survives a redesign that
            moves every element; a selector-specific override does not.

Rules this follows, because a proxy that gets them wrong is worse than none:

  · Only text/html (and text/css when `recolor` is set) is buffered and
    rewritten. Everything else is relayed byte-for-byte as it arrives, so a
    long or streaming response never sits in memory waiting to be complete.
  · Accept-Encoding is stripped on the way in. Upstream then sends plain text
    and there is no gzip to decode before the rewrite, and none to re-encode
    after it.
  · A 101 is spliced raw in both directions and never rewritten — a websocket
    app's `Connection: Upgrade` is load-bearing.
  · The injected <head> is idempotent — a page already carrying the marker is
    passed through untouched, so a re-proxied response cannot accumulate.

There is a second use worth knowing about: some dev servers (Vite, for one)
refuse a Host header they do not recognise, which makes them 403 behind
`tailscale serve` even though the port is reachable. This front rewrites Host
to 127.0.0.1:<origin>, which those servers accept — so it fixes that without
binding the app to 0.0.0.0 or patching a file you do not own.

Stdlib only, like every other server here. No build step, no deps.
