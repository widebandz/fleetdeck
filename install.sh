# install.sh — reconcile this machine with this repo.
#
# The repo is the source of truth. Both python servers are executed IN PLACE
# from here (the generated plists point at these paths), so this only places
# the parts that must live elsewhere:
#
#   bin/fleetdeck             -> ~/bin/fleetdeck            (on PATH)
#   launchagents/*.plist.tmpl -> ~/Library/LaunchAgents/     (launchd only scans there)
#
# The .tmpl files are rendered with this repo's path, this machine's HOME, the
# python3 you actually have, and the label_prefix + ports from config.json.
#
# COPIES, not symlinks, on purpose. macOS attributes TCC grants to a binary's
# RESOLVED REAL PATH — that is how a `brew upgrade python` silently voided this
# project's grants once already. Symlinking a launchd job's program into a
# different real path invites the same failure, and launchd has its own history
# of refusing symlinked plists. `fleetdeck doctor` reports drift instead, which
# is the cheap half of the trade.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to re-run. Does not touch tmux sessions.
