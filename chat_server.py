fleetdeck chat — the tmux fleet as a Messages-style thread list.

Left rail is one row per tmux session (hue-matched to its wall tile, newest
activity on top, unread dot when it has produced output since you last looked).
Tapping a row opens that session in the pane on the right — and it is NOT a
transcript: the pane is a live, writable tmux client. The "conversation" is a
real shell.

WHY A PROXY AND NOT A SECOND ttyd PORT
--------------------------------------
The terminal is ttyd (already trusted here, already carrying the mobile viewport
patch). One instance runs on LOOPBACK with -a/--url-arg, so the browser picks
the session per-iframe:

    /t/?arg=new-session&arg=-A&arg=-s&arg=media   ->   tmux new-session -A -s media

Everything under /t is byte-proxied to it from this server, which means:
  * one origin, so one credential prompt — an iframe pointed at another port
    raises its own basic-auth wall, and Chrome will not fetch() from a URL with
    credentials embedded (the same wall that forced /?key= on the messages app);
  * ttyd itself never listens anywhere but 127.0.0.1, and the proxy injects the
    Authorization header upstream, so it is still credentialed at both hops.
ttyd runs with -b /t because its client derives /token and /ws from
window.location.pathname — the iframe sits at /t/, so those land at /t/token
and /t/ws and ttyd has to know to strip the base.

WINDOW SIZE, i.e. WHAT THIS DOES TO THE WALL
--------------------------------------------
tmux renders one window at one size, so a phone attaching to a session that is
also tiled on the wall is a genuine conflict, not a bug to fix. Two modes:
  live (default) — plain attach. The browser becomes the newest client and
      `window-size latest` hands it the size, so the wall tile reshapes to the
      phone WHILE the tab is open and snaps back when it closes (closing the
      thread tears the iframe down, ttyd SIGHUPs `tmux attach`, the client
      detaches, and the wall client becomes latest again).
  peek — attach -f ignore-size,read-only. The session keeps the wall's
      geometry and refuses keystrokes: look at what an agent is doing without
      touching it or disturbing the wall. Costs you the ability to type, and
      the pane may be wider than the phone.

WHERE THIS LIVES
----------------
Keep this repo OUT of ~/Documents and ~/Desktop. Those are TCC-protected, and a
launchd job cannot read them without a Full Disk Access grant that you will
forget you needed. ~/.config or ~/srv is safe.

Shebang is /usr/bin/python3 — Apple's path never moves, unlike
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3, which every `brew upgrade python` relocates and
which took this project's launchd jobs down once already.

        Forward the request head verbatim (path included — ttyd's -b matches /t

        the 101 like any other response is what makes the websocket work without
        special-casing it.

        The one thing this must NOT do is relay the response head verbatim.
        libwebsockets hangs up right after serving the index, but its 200 does
        not say `Connection: close` — so a browser parks the very next request
        (/t/token, which ttyd's client fetches before it will open the socket)
        on a connection this end has already dropped, and the terminal sits
        blank forever with the fetch pending and no error anywhere. Costs an
        hour to find because curl reconnects silently and never reproduces it.
        So: force close semantics in both directions on ordinary responses, and
        leave a 101 strictly alone (its `Connection: Upgrade` is load-bearing)."""
